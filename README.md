# Several_Classificators

The **objective** of this repository is to practice a simple implementation of classification algorithms, from obtaining the data to preprocessing it and feeding it to the algorithms.

Classificators implemented:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
  - With and without bagging
- AdaBoost

Along with this classificators there are several implementations to **improve their performance**.
